Changelog
=========

0.0.3 (2012-03-20)
------------------

- Now supports tracking maximum versions of fields::

      [postdeploy]
      history.track =
          environment:zopes max

  The default tracking action is called ``removed``.

  In this example, ``history.environment.zopes`` would be the largest number of
  zopes this buildout deployment has had. The use case for this is that your
  buildout just destroyed the start/stop scripts for those olds zopes and you
  want to make sure they were actually stopped. I could then do something like
  this from my Yaybu configuration::

    .foreach i in range(buildout.environment.zopes, history.environment.zopes):
      - Execute:
          name: stop-forgotten-zope-${i}
          command: kill-command zope${i}
          unless: some-manual-pid-check


0.0.2 (2012-03-17)
------------------

- Any sections that are simple metadata and not referenced from a part will now
  be available in postdeploy configuration. Note that if a section isn't
  referenced by an installed part and uses variables then it can't be included:
  the act of inspecting it might cause additional buildout recipes to be
  executed.


0.0.1 (2012-03-16)
------------------

- Fix packaging


0.0.0 (2012-03-16)
------------------
